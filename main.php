<!-- HOW PHP WORKS -->
<!-- The PHP interpreter is called when a web-page 
	(with .php or equivalent extension) is loaded -->
<!-- This could be when you click on a link, submit a form 
	or type in the URL of a page -->
<!-- PHP then does nothing until the browser requests another PHP page
PHP is a server side so you don't need to worry about browser compatibility -->

<!-- PHP RUNS CROSS PLATFORM -->
<!-- PHP runs on almost any Web server -->
<!-- One of the srongest featrues is the wide range of supported databases
		Web Servers: Apache, Microsoft IIS, Caudium, Netscape Enterprise Server
		Operating Sustems: UNIX, Mac OSX, Windows
		Supported Databases: MySQL, ODBC, oracle(OCL7 and OCI8), Ovrimos,
		PostgresSQL, SQLLite, Solid, Subase, Velocis, Unix dbm -->

<!-- INTERPRETING & COMPILING -->
<!-- re-compiles your script each time it is requested
	provides very quick feedback during development
all memory used by the script is manaaged by PHP
	automatically cleans up after every script has finished
	no need to worry about closing databse links
